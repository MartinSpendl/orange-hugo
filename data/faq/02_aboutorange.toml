    answer = """Core Orange supports Excel, comma- and tab-delimited files (.xlsx, .csv, .tab). It also reads online data, such as Google Spreadsheets. SQL widget supports PostgreSQL and MSSQL databases. <br><br>Add-ons can load additional formats. For example, Orange3-ImageAnalytics add-on can import images (.jpg, .tiff, .png) and Orange3-Text add-on can import text files (.txt, .docx, .pdf)."""

    answer = """Orange provides the SQL widget, which samples data instances and enables exploratory data analysis on large datasets. You need <a href="http://initd.org/psycopg/">psycopg2</a> module installed to be able to see the widget. Go to Options - Add-ons, select <em>Add more...</em>, then enter the name of the pip package. It is <code>psycopg2</code> command for Windows and <code>psycopg2-binary</code> for OSX. Alternatively, you can install it directly in your Python environment with <code>pip install psycopg2</code>. You can also use <a href="https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/resources/2uda/">2UDA package</a> for easier installation. Please note that Orange supports only PostgreSQL and MSSQL databases for now."""

    question = "How do I add comments/annotations to my workflows?"
    answer = """There is an option in the lower left corner of the canvas. The "T" icon adds text comments, while the arrow icon adds an arrow.

    question = "How safe is my data?"
